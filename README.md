# rekognition_with_cloudinary_flutter

A Flutter having most advanced way to detect labels from images uploaded to Cloudinary.
<br>
**About the app**:-<br>
This app is made keeping in mind the problem faced by a company who wants to identify labels from thousands of images and want much more storage for free of cost.<br> If you are familier with AWS then you might be knowing about Rekognition. It helps us to detect labels from images passed to it. AWS provides a function in which you can directly store the image in S3 and can detect the labels from it but if you want to use the image again and again in your app and ther are many users for your app then this might cost you and to avoid this cost the method used in this app is the best one.<br>
For example you have an app where you want to probit the uploading and keeping of Nude images and voilent images you can use S3 with Rekognition but what is these are the profile images. You need to load them each time your user opens tha app and S3 has limited calling of images. If you use cloudinary you get 4x storage as comapred to S3 for free on you account and there is no such codt applicable when you try to access the image or put the image in you cloud storage.<br>
